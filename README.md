Data consists of 3 columns separated by tabs

If there is no data, then a dash "-" (without quotes) is put, but it is assumed that the date is always there

The day and month of the date are always specified by two characters, for example, 
 the first of May 1900 will be "01.05.1900" (without quotes)
